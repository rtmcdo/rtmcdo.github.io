##Hello world!

<My name is Ryan McDonald, and I work at Microsoft as a Principal Program Manager in Microsoft Security. Previous to working for Micorosft, I was a Senior Vice President of Services at <a href="https://www.10thmagnitude.com/">10th Magnitude</a> which was acquired by Cognizant in 2020.

My background is 20+ years of infrastructure, operations, and security experience in the Microsoft tech stack delivering technical leadership, vision, and a wide range of functions for start-up, high growth, and enterprise organizations
